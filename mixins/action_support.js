// Support for firing an action, given a target, action and an optional payload. Any of those
// can naturally be defined with a binding. Furthermore, if target is a path the resolves to
// a string, that string is again resolved as a path, etc. until it resolved on non-string.
// For example, target could be 'parentView.controller', which could resolve to
// 'MyApp.fooController', which would then resolve to a controller object. If target is not
// defined, it defaults to the view itself.
//
// Action can be defined as a string or a function. If it's a function, it's called with the
// target bound to 'this'.
//
// If payload is not defined, it defaults to the view itself.
